# My Todo List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  It is a simple Single Page App (SPA) with limited styling, designed to showcase the use of two plugins:  [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) and [JSDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc).

Ultimately, we weren't overly thrilled about JSDoc's auto-generated documentation.  [This medium article](https://wojciechkrysiak.medium.com/document-reactjs-components-with-preview-by-using-jsdoc-70d39d2cc777) suggests the use of [parcel-bundler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-bundler) and a `@component` tag to better handle components.  Regardless of the auto-generated documentation, the use of JSDoc-style comments is still of great use in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which includes support for JSDoc commenting out of the box.

## Getting started
In the root of the project, run `npm install` to install necessary components.  Use `npm start` to fire up the project for local development.  Once loaded, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  The page will conveniently reload if you make edits.
